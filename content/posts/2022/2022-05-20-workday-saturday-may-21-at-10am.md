🍅🐝 🐞



We have a workday on **Saturday,May 21at 10am.**  

## **Here is the list of tasks that we'll work on**

1. cleanup behind the fence on the east side
2. spread gravel including around the new beds and along the perimeter of the west garden where the new fencing was installed
3. paint the shed roofs
4. committees should meet

## **Reminders / announcements /info**

1. There are some free plants on a table near the port-o-potty. Please feel free to take one.
2. The water barrels in the east garden should not be shoved against the wall. That is a known rat route and we want to avoid giving them cover. The barrels should be 18 inches away from the wall.
3. Two bags of compost per bed. Please make sure to take your allotment this weekend.
4. Please do not plant additional plants in the areas that were cleared due to the new fencing. This is important perimeter space that we need to keep clear in line with our rat prevention strategy.
5. We will circulate the roster and committee lists as well as bed assignments in time for the workday!
