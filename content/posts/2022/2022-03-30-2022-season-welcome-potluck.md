The 2022 season is nearly here!

The opening meeting will take place onApril2nd, 2022 beginning at 10 a.m. Since this is a potluck, please bring a dish that serves 6-8 people. Remember that we will be outdoors and will have no way to reheat or warm any dishes.

Following the meeting, weâ€™ll have a short work day to get the garden ready for the season.

Lots of important information will be shared, but we will keep it brief and fun. This is a great opportunity to meet the Steering Committee, your fellow gardeners and get answers to any burning questions you may have.

Attached is a REVISED list of the work days for the 2022 season.

Hope to see you all there!

Thank you,

West 104 Steering Committee
