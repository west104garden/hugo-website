In case garden members are interested:  
Next weekend there will be an orchid show by the Manhattan Orchid Society on the Upper West Side at The Plant Shed Caf√©, 555 Columbus ([87th St.](x-apple-data-detectors://0)). I think it might be the first orchid society show in Manhattan since the large GYNOS shows in the old Winter Garden and Rockefeller Center over a decade ago, though on a much smaller scale. While this event will be pretty modest, it may evolve to something much grander in the future.

There will be two vendors -- J&L orchids, which sells very cool miniatures, and Orchidphile, which sells fancy phalaenopsis (the latest breedings of the moth orchids you see at Home Depot and TJ's).

This is a rare opportunity -- you can find them at NJ or LI shows a couple of times a year, but those shows are a bit of a hike for Manhattan dwellers especially without a car.

There will also be two workshops each day (1 and[2 pm](x-apple-data-detectors://3)). I'm not sure of the topics. The show and workshops will be free to attend. Flyer is attached.
