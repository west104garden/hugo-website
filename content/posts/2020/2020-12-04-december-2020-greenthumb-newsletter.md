**GreenThumb GrowTogether Workshop Proposals 2021**

Due to COVID-19, the GrowTogether will be fully virtual this year, and spread out over multiple days. We're inviting a wide range of workshop/webinar proposals about community gardening, seeds, composting, biodiversity, ecology, resilience, food and racial justice, herbalism, group development, community organizing, native plants, climate change, intergenerational gardening, garden/crop/movement histories, and more. We're grateful for your offer to share your knowledge at our 37th annual conference, in an ongoing tradition of uplifting and celebrating community gardening in NYC since 1984.

_The conference will take place[Saturday, February 20 through Saturday, February 27](x-apple-data-detectors://3)in a virtual format. Due to budget constraints during the pandemic, we are sadly unable to provide workshop materials or t-shirts this year._

**GreenThumb Growing Food Toolkit**

GreenThumb supports community gardeners in growing food through educational workshops and materials. In the[GreenThumb Growing Food Toolkit](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/news.html?news_id=480), you will find most of our workshop handouts and webinar recordings, as well as many resources from partnering organizations, on topics related to food production. We will continue to add to this page and update our educational resources as time and capacity allows.

**GreenThumb Composting Toolkit and COVID-19 Compost Safety Guide**

Many GreenThumb gardens host volunteer-run community composting operations or host food scrap drop-off sites. Due to COVID-19, curbside organics collection by the NYC Department of Sanitation is temporarily suspended and some food scrap drop-offs are currently closed. Because of these changes in the composting landscape, GreenThumb gardeners are seeing a growing public interest in composting at community gardens. The[COVID-19 Compost Safety Guide](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/newspdf/COVID-19%20Compost%20Safety%20Guide%20V.4.pdf)provides guidance to existing compost sites on best practices for preventing the spread of COVID-19 during compost drop-offs or during use of the compost area. Gardens that are curious to learn more about the art and science of composting can refer to the[Compost Toolkit](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/newspdf/Compost%20Resource%20Guide%20-%20FINAL.pdf), a compilation of webinars, videos, and publications from partners and compost experts.

**The Urban Farmer-to-Farmer Summit**

**[Saturday December 5, 10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.](x-apple-data-detectors://10)**

[**RSVP at this link for full details**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-urban-farmer-to-farmer-summit-tickets-123405381819)

The growing of food is an act of resiliency and sustainability, often led by People of Color, specifically Black, Indigenous, and Latinx communities. We acknowledge that during this current health pandemic, issues of food access, sovereignty, justice and inequity have been exacerbated.

The Urban Farmer-to-Farmer Summit has been created in solidarity to provide more structure for the NYC Urban Farm Community to come together. In community and collaboration, we aim to share resources, reflect on misadventures, strengthen connections, and highlight new opportunities to rise to the challenges of our times. Our hope is to make this an annual farmer-driven event with a low barrier to participate.
