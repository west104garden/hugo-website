Dear all,

As discussed at the brunch, there are a few 311 calls you could all help us put in. You can say you are calling about a Parks department maintenance problem and make the following three complaints.

- 8 West 104th st, at the back of the garden lot (south side, western portion): there is no retaining wall. The area is unstable and unsafe and rats have burrowed there. We need a retaining wall.

- 8 West 104th st, south side: the fence is falling down and needs to be replaced.

- 8 West 104th st, along the western edge: the retaining wall is falling onto the neighboring lot and is making it difficult/impossible for the neighbor to maintain the strip. This area needs to be maintained to keep the rats out and we don't have access to it. Our retaining wall needs to be fixed.

Thank you!  
Your friends thegardenworms
