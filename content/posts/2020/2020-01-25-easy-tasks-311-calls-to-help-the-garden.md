Dear all,

Can you all help us with putting 311 requests in? The eastgardenneeds lots of help and the DOB and Greenthumb people I've talked to say that putting in 311 requests could help a lot. Here is what we need:

- west side of east garden: the retaining wall is falling down (and rats hide in there)

- south side (west) of eastgarden: we need a new retaining wall where thegardenis flowing out under the fence (safety issue)

- south side (east) of the eastgarden: we need the holes in front of the retaining wall filled in with cement (rats hide in there)

- south side of eastgarden: we need a new fence as our fence is falling down (safety issue)

Feel free to call 311 or put it in on the app. Here is the address: 8 west 104. The more people who put in requests the better!

Thank you!

Bethany
