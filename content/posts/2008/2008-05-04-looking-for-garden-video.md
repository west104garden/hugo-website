## Looking for a garden video!

A neighbor asked that I pass this on to those creating videos on garden

### -----Forwarded Message-----

_From: Lisa Guido_

please pass this along to your gardening compadres, especially the media types, and by all means forward to me anything
you think fits the bill.

We are a brand new show, in old and new media. (The next email you get from me might be from *UnscrewAmerica*, or
*GritTV*.) 

The host and driving force of the project is [Laura Flanders](http://lauraflanders.com), currently of RadioNation on Air America. Laura will be conducting interviews and hosting debates in studio, but a full quarter of the program will be viewer and
partner-generated material: commentaries, news pieces, satires, documentaries in progress and how-tos. We'll post the
segments online for a while with a link back to your site, as well as embed it in the daily show. 

I would love to see radical gardeners represented, so send me your tapes! If you've produced a piece for your website about composting, or community gardens, let me know. Send me a link! Your submissions and suggestions are very welcome. Please feel free to pass my information along to anyone with work already made or in production that you think fits the bill. 

There's a regular segment of works-in-progress from documentary makers and social justice-minded producers of culture. The studio
element is a mix of community activists, authors, the biggies in progressive politics, thinkers of all sorts. We'll
cover a very broad range of topics. The show will air weeknights on FreeSpeechTV (Dish Network -- and community access
cable and college stations) right after Democracy Now, and daily, noon, on political
blog [Firedoglake.com](http://Firedoglake.com) [http://firedoglake.com/](http://firedoglake.com). 
(and, when it launches, on Robert Greenwald's new web channel.) I think it will provide excellent exposure to some new audiences --
especially the web outlets. 

Warmest Regards, 
Lisa Guido
