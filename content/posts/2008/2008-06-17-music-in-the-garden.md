## Music in the W. 104 St. Community Garden this Saturday, June 21!

Please come to the garden for a day of free music in celebration of the Summer Solstice--part of the Make Music New York Festival. Bring your friends and family!

The program is a great one, including a children's program, jazz, and classical music.

Please invite all your friends and neighbors. We want to make these musicians, who are playing for free, feel welcome.

* 11 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. - For children and their parents: Classical musician Vita Wallace of Orfeo Duo will teach children and others how to make and play instruments in the garden. 
* 1 p.m. - 2.30 p.m. - JAZZ: The Rob Jacoby Quartet, with sax, guitar, base and drums. 
* 2.30 p.m. - 4 p.m. - JAZZ: Sam Salinger and friends 
* 4 p.m. - 5.15 p.m. - CLASSICAL: Royden Ringer woodwind duo

Make a picnic of it-- food will be on sale. The Garden is between Central Park West and Manhattan Ave. -- close to the B & C W. 103 stop, and the Broadway 104 stop.
