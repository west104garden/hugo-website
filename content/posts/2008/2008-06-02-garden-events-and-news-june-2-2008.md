## Other News 

Yours truly is re-registering our Garden for the 2009-2011 seasons, required as part of the Settlement Agreement and 
Green Thumb regulations -- that we continue to obtain various GT goodies and supplies all year.
We are not in danger of losing our Parks land designation so long as we continue to hold open Public Events -- such as
the three listed above -- and maintain our gardens in a kempt manner. 
We're considered one of the better-run and maintained gardens in NYC, so thanks to all of you for this accolade. 
All for now
