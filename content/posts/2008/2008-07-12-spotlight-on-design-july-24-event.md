Hi Gardeners

Thought you might be interested in this New Yorkers for Parks program about our parks, their design, and various issues that we in our garden might want to think about--passive and active solar, wind power, etc. Please note that you can attend for free if you make reservations. (Phone number at the end.)

## Spotlight on Design: Building in the City's Parks

Designing new buildings for parks offers some of the greatest challenges and opportunities in urban architecture today, as planners balance effects on the landscape with practical uses. Join some of the city's leaders in park design as they discuss the aesthetic and environmental considerations that go into planning tomorrow's innovative park buildings today, including use of lawns as roofs, buildings as armatures for tapestries of living plants, wind turbines, passive and active solar power, and building textures evocative of owl feathers.

Charles McKinney, Chief of Design of Capital Projects for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, will lead a discussion on using buildings as landscape with Greg Kiss of Kiss and Cathcart and Jennifer Sage and Peter Coombeof Sage and Coombe.
