These Area Events will surely interest some. Last year the Garden hosted a 'Make Music NY' event with Member David Wilke
teaching the guitar to children. Also several of our Garden youngsters are Dance students.

## 1. Make Music New York on Saturday, June 21

Last year, on the summer solstice, Make Music New York organized one of the biggest musical events in the city's
history: 560 free outdoor concerts in an array of genres and locations. Thousands of musicians -- from Metropolitan
Opera artists to underground MC's, Tuvan throat singers to high school bands -- entertained New Yorkers on sidewalks,
streets, parks, gardens, and even cemeteries in the five boroughs. 

On Saturday, June 21, 2008, Make Music New York is back -- and it's going to be even bigger! For the second annual event, Time Out New York magazine has launched a website to match musicians with locations. Now anyone can find a space for their music... or music for their space.


### Participating locations on June 21st are invited to

* Choose musicians from our database, or invite their own to perform.
* Provide electricity for an outdoor performance (for example, running an extension cord out to the sidewalk that day)
* Put up a free, customizable poster in the window during June, promoting the concert.

### The Make Music New York organizers will then

* Secure and send you all necessary permits
* Coordinate your concert with others in the neighborhood
* Promote your establishment as a concert location in all programs, on [timeoutnewyork.com](http://timeoutnewyork.com),
  and in an 8-page amNewYork newspaper supplement running on June 20th.


### Details

There is no charge to take part -- everything is completely free. All concert arrangements must be finalized by May 1st.
To get started, go to [www.timeoutnewyork.com/makemusic](http://www.timeoutnewyork.com/makemusic). In a parallel section
of the site, restaurants, bars, shops, gardens, block associations, management companies and others can sign up to make
their outdoor space available for musicians on June 21. 

Each will list its location, a description of the space, the availability of electricity, ways in which they will promote the concert and what type of music they prefer. The website will then show possible matches based on each participant's choices, with contact info (through the site or offline).

Once a venue and a performing act have made a match, information is routed to [Make Music New York's](http://www.makemusicny.org) 
organizers, who confirm concert details and secure the necessary permits. Not long after the site is launched, a map showing existing  
concert locations will be added, making available (and unavailable) sites visible at a glance. The new site will allow MMNY 
to grow even bigger, giving participants more freedom to create the concerts they want to have.

Aaron Friedman, President, Make Music New York makemusicny@gmail.com. I hope that locations in the 6th Council District will
sign up!
