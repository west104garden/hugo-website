Hi Folks,

Over the holiday, the West 104th Community Garden rescued four adorable kittens from the garden and neighboring yard. As medical costs are significantly high, the Steering Committee is seeking donations for their care. Cat Committee member, Nikki is fundraising to cover the vet expenses via GoFundMe.

Meet (from left to right): Maggie, Bart, Lisa and Ralphie. Probably about 8 weeks old but that's a guess. They are pictured in my bathroom, where they have been for the last week.

yes üëè The good news is that they seem healthy and are certainly friendly. Before they can be adopted they have to see a vet. We are using Brilliant Vet Care, a new vet in the neighborhood, which is giving us discount rates. The goal is to raise enough money to cover the first vet visit and the spay/ neuter, which will come in a few weeks.

Any support you can offer will be greatly appreciated.

Kittens all adopted in pairs. Everyone goes to vet for spay/neuter this Thursday. Please consider adopting an older cat if you want a single feline for your household. Check out the cats at Purrfect Cats of NYC. The cats are friendly, healthy and and will repay the love you give them.

Dear Nice Humans: with your help, we can pay for the kittens' first vet visit. They have worms (yuck but treatable) , but not leukemia (yay!). Wonderful staff at Brilliant Vets giving them their best possible start!

Hi Everyone,

Sending a quick update on the 4 kittens: Lisa, Bart, Maggie and Ralphie. They are heading to the vet tomorrow with Nikki for shots, deworming, Leukemiatesting, etc. Neutering and spaying will happen a bit later. Photos of their vet visit will follow.

As youcan see they like to hang out together and with humans. Who can resistthosecute faces? Sara, Nikki and a few others are providing hours of attention sothey can become socialized and easily adoptable. If anyone would like a pair or know of anyone who would be interested, please write to the garden email and we'll keep a list.

The trap is set for the momma cat, since she was recently spotted in the garden area. Sara Lewkowicz is working overtime on her capture, so please sendgood energy her way.  
We want to take care of the momma, too, so yourdonations are still needed,[https://gofund.me/4ef75bd5](https://gofund.me/4ef75bd5).

Many have been very generous and even others have provided cash outside of the GoFundMe platform. It is all so much appreciated. Kitten food, litter, toy donations are also welcome if youhappen to have some you'd like to donate.

Ciao and Meow...
