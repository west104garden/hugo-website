Good afternoon Gardeners,  
  
Our final meeting and workday of the season isthis Saturday, December 4th. We use this final day to prepare the garden for winter and many hands make light work! THERE WILL BE REFRESHMENTS(in case you need another good reason to be there).  
  
In addition to the garden work, this will also be the final meeting of the membership until March 2022, and we'll be discussing some important topics, including new opportunities for members to get involved in the coming months. This will also be an opportunity for questions regarding upcoming votes and nominations for the steering committee (a separate detailed email will be circulated on these topics), so please join us!  
  
Saturday's Agenda:  
  
1\. Toy Drive  
2\. Steering Committee Nominations  
3\. Questions about upcoming votes  
4\. New committees for 2022, and committees that need additional help  
5\. Volunteers to help with grant writing  
6\. Garden tasks-water barrels, cisterns, umbrellas, furniture  
  
Hope to see you there,  
West 104 Garden Steering Committee
