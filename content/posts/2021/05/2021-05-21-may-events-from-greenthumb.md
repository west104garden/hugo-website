Hi all -- Please see below for information and events from Greenthumb.

**GreenThumb Gardeners' Handbook 2021**

The[2021 Edition of the GreenThumb Gardeners' Handbook](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/pdf/GreenThumb_Gardeners_Handbook_2021.pdf)is a resource for community gardeners and the general public that covers a variety of topics, including event planning, construction work, accepting donations, selling garden produce, tree pruning, garden bylaws, and much more. The handbook includes many, but not all, GreenThumb, NYC Parks, New York City, and New York State best practices, policies, and laws that pertain to community gardens in the GreenThumb network. Gathering these topics and policies in one place helps gardeners in creating and sustaining these thriving public spaces. Gardeners have informed policies, guidelines, and protocols included in this Handbook, and GreenThumb is grateful for the immense time and grassroot effort community gardeners put into making gardens beautiful, productive, and community-centric for more than 40 years.

The Handbook is available to all garden members and members of the public in[digital form here on our website](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/news.html?news_id=469)and will soon be available at the same link in multiple languages.

**CitizensNYC All In Neighborhood Grants Available**

Grassroots organizations responding to the immediate needs of struggling New Yorkers will receive unrestricted grants of up to $10,000 to open food pantries, distribute surgical masks, arrange elderly check-ins, or design other projects to meet their neighborhoods’ urgent needs amid the COVID-19 crisis. This grant program is a renaming of our keystone Neighborhood Grants program, which for decades has been awarding micro-grants to resident-led groups to improve the quality of life in their neighborhoods. Grants supported projects in arts, health, environmental justice, beautification, tenants’ rights, and more. Groups do not need 501c3 status to apply and receive the funding. CitizensNYC quickly shifted the focus of this program after findings of a survey we conducted of our extensive grassroots network highlighted five urgent priorities across the city: financial assistance, food, care for older adults, mental health care, and physical health care.

Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.[You can learn more about the grant, sign up for an info session and apply here](https://www.citizensnyc.org/grantmaking)
