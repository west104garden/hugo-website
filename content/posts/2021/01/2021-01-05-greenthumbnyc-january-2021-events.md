**GreenThumb Programming Updates**

**GreenThumb Growing Food Toolkit**

GreenThumb supports community gardeners in growing food through educational workshops and materials. In the[GreenThumb Growing Food Toolkit](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/news.html?news_id=480), you will find most of our workshop handouts and webinar recordings, as well as many resources from partnering organizations, on topics related to food production. We will continue to add to this page and update our educational resources as time and capacity allows.

**GreenThumb Composting Toolkit and COVID-19 Compost Safety Guide**

Many GreenThumb gardens host volunteer-run community composting operations or host food scrap drop-off sites. Due to COVID-19, curbside organics collection by the NYC Department of Sanitation is temporarily suspended and some food scrap drop-offs are currently closed. Because of these changes in the composting landscape, GreenThumb gardeners are seeing a growing public interest in composting at community gardens. The[COVID-19 Compost Safety Guide](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/newspdf/COVID-19%20Compost%20Safety%20Guide%20V.4.pdf)provides guidance to existing compost sites on best practices for preventing the spread of COVID-19 during compost drop-offs or during use of the compost area. Gardens that are curious to learn more about the art and science of composting can refer to the[Compost Toolkit](https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/newspdf/Compost%20Resource%20Guide%20-%20FINAL.pdf), a compilation of webinars, videos, and publications from partners and compost experts.
