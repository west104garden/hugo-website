Dear Neighbor,

Welcome to the West 104th Street Community Garden!

Vacant for two decades, the lots that make up the Garden were overhauled in 1993 with support from the North West
Central Park Multiblock Association and Operation Green Thumb, the largest community gardening program in the country.
In 1998, Garden members successfully lobbied to have the property made into an official New York City Park to protect it
from commercial development.

The East Garden offers the comfort of a shady gazebo, two productive peach trees, and open space for meetings, social
events and performances. The West Garden includes a large communal herb garden, a patio for barbecuing and a lovely rose
arbor dedicated to the memory of Jesse Crawford, one of the chief organizers of the garden. Ample space in both gardens
is devoted to communal garden beds, which are cooperatively tended by members, as well as beds assigned to individual
members.

Today, West 104th Garden boasts a membership of over 50 households and is overseen by Green Thumb. Membership is open to
all New York City residents. Find out about joining the garden on the Membership page and read the Garden Rules.

Welcome to your Garden!

## ðŸš§ Warning: construction ahead

Dear reader, be advised this site is quite incomplete (and intentionally so).

West 104 street garden has an [active website](https://west104garden.com/) why mess with a good thing?

I thought it would be nice to re-post old content, as thought going back in time to see how the website began back in
2008, maybe get some inspiration for what a community garden can feel like, what kinds of posts were happening "before
my time".

2008 is quite hard to imagine on command, it is an internet not as concerned with hackers stealing your information,
there are no password managers or GDPR. Facebook was only 4 years old and not nearly as ominously influencing our
societies.

What did we do on the web?
