## ðŸš§ Warning: construction ahead

Dear reader, be advised this site is quite incomplete (and intentionally so).

West 104 street garden has an [active website](https://west104garden.com/) why mess with a good thing?

I thought it would be nice to re-post old content, as thought going back in time to see how the website began back in 2008, maybe get some inspiration for what a community garden can feel like, what kinds of posts were happening "before my time".


2008 is quite hard to imagine on command, it is an internet not as concerned with hackers stealing your information, there are no password managers or GDPR. Facebook was only 4 years old and not nearly as ominously influencing our societies.

What did we do on the web?
